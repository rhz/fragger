# Fragger

Little [Scala.js](https://www.scala-js.org/) web application that uses
the [graph-rewriting](https://github.com/rhz/graph-rewriting/) library
to compute the mean ocurrence count of graph observables in a given
[graph transformation system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_rewriting).

Forked from [scala-js-example-app](https://github.com/sjrd/scala-js-example-app).
